Roughly 35% of small-business owners in a survey said they've needed to tap their own funds \\u2014 via a personal credit card and/or savings, for example \\u2014 to help prop up their business in the months since the coronavirus whacked the U.S. economy, according to a new survey from CreditCards.com. Other sources serving as a lifeline included business credit cards or a business savings account, and loans (including through the Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP). Altogether, 70% in the survey said they have leaned on one or more of those sources to remain in business since the coronavirus pandemic began. \\\"These are tough numbers,\\\" said Ted Rossman, industry analyst for CreditCards.com. \\\"They show just how dire this is for small businesses, and also how intertwined their personal and business finances are. \\\"You kind of have to worry about some of them compromising their own financial well-being,\\\" Rossman said. The survey results, based on a poll of 500 small-business owners in mid-July, come as congressional lawmakers debate how best to help businesses (and households) that are struggling amid continuing economic uncertainty. An expansion of the PPP loans, as well as tweaks to the rules applying to their use and forgiveness, are among the provisions being considered for inclusion in the next coronavirus relief package. While those PPP loans can be forgiven if the money is used for certain expenses and follows other guidelines, the same can't be said for some other sources. Business credit cards, especially, come with what may surprise some owners: Depending on the terms of your \\\"business\\\" card, you may be personally responsible for any balance. \\\"It's a bit of a misconception because these cards might give you better rewards on business stuff like office supplies or online advertising but in the end, they require a personal guarantee,\\\" Rossman said. \\\"So usually the owner ends up being on the hook personally.\\\" More from Invest in You:Quarantine spending was more than just hoarding canned goodsPrices go up every year. That doesn't mean you have to pay more If you need cash, try these less-obvious sources Typically, he said, corporate credit cards that allow the company itself to guarantee the debt are given to businesses with at least $1 million in revenue. Otherwise, any balance on the card is usually the responsibility of the owner, even if the business closes permanently. Meanwhile, 71% of small businesses say they have used up all of their PPP loan, according to a recent National Federation of Independent Business survey of its members. \\\"The longer this stretches on, the more help that will be needed,\\\" Rossman said. \\\"If there's not substantial government stimulus, we'll see a lot more businesses and consumers falling behind.\\\" SIGN UP: Money 101 is an 8-week learning course to financial freedom, delivered weekly to your inbox.

In February, the median sale price for new construction sold in the U.S. was $400,500, according to the U.S. Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. More from Personal Finance: Should you refinance your mortgage?Buyers of newly built homes can face a property tax surpriseHousing 'affordability has just totally collapsed' But the value of a newly built house will depend on multiple factors, including the finishes that are added, said certified financial planner Veronica Fuentes, a wealth management advisor based in Washington, D.C. \\\"They want to know what kind of windows you want, flooring, siding, window panels, what kind of doors, where you want the outlets, what kind of light switches do you want. Depending on what you're picking, they're adding up the tab,\\\" Fuentes said. To save on costs with a new build, it may be in a potential buyer's best interest to hire a contractor later on to add desired finishes, experts say. \\\"Think about those elements that could be easily added at a later date,\\\" said Angie Hicks, home expert and co-founder of Angi, an online marketplace that connects homeowners with professional contractors for home maintenance or renovations. While multiple elements contribute to the overall cost of a newly built house, one way to keep the price within range is by deferring elements for future renovations or upgrades, experts say. To that point, homeowners spent on average $13,667 across 11.1 projects in 2023, a slightly higher level compared with 2022, according to the State of Home Spending by Angi. The survey polled 6,400 consumers between Oct. 22 and Oct. 23. Almost half (46%) of homeowners used cash from savings to cover renovations. About 20% used credit cards, while a minority, 7%, refinanced an existing loan and 5% used a home equity line of credit loan. \\\"I tell my clients to be very conservative,\\\" said Fuentes, as buyers can always change the knobs, the flooring and the paint on the walls through hired contractors. To that point, experts recommend focusing on the structural elements. While costs range depending on materials, labors and location, most homeowners paid between $14,611 and $41,440 to remodel a kitchen in 2024, Angi found. Meanwhile, bathroom remodels can range from $6,629 to $17,536. If you know you will be upgrading features in the house, go with the basic or lowest priced features for now, Hicks said. \\\"There's no reason to finish it out right when you build the house necessarily,\\\" Hicks said. \\\"Those are things that can be added later and can potentially save you in the near term.\\\" Got a confidential news tip?
